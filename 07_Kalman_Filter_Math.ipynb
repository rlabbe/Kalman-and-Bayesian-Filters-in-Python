    "** author's note:** *the ordering of material in this chapter is questionable. I delve into solving ODEs before discussing the basic Kalman equations.

    "If you've gotten this far I hope that you are thinking that the Kalman filter's fearsome reputation is somewhat undeserved. Sure, I hand waved some equations away, but I hope implementation has been fairly straightforward for you. The underlying concept is quite straightforward - take two measurements, or a measurement and a prediction, and choose the output to be somewhere between the two. If you believe the measurement more your guess will be closer to the measurement, and if you believe the prediction is more accurate your guess will lie closer it it. That's not rocket science (little joke - it is exactly this math that got Apollo to the moon and back!). \n",

    "Well, to be honest I have been choosing my problems carefully. For any arbitrary problem finding some of the matrices that we need to feed into the Kalman filter equations can be quite difficult. I haven't been *too tricky*, though. Equations like Newton's equations of motion can be trivially computed for Kalman filter applications, and they make up the bulk of the kind of problems that we want to solve. If you are a hobbyist, you can safely pass by this chapter for now, and perhaps forever. Some of the later chapters will assume the material in this chapter, but much of the work will still be accessible to you. \n",

    "The title of this book is *Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python* but to date I have not touched on the Bayesian aspect much. There was enough going on in the earlier chapters that adding this form of reasoning about filters could be a distraction rather than a help. I now which to take some time to explain what Bayesian probability is and how a Kalman filter is in fact a Bayesian filter. This is not just a diversion. First of all, a lot of the Kalman filter literature uses this formulation when talking about filters, so you will need to understand what they are talking about. Second, this math plays a strong role in filtering design once we move past the Kalman filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so we will go back to our first tracking problem - tracking a dog in a hallway. Recall the update step - we believed with some degree of precision that the dog was at position 7 (for example), and then receive a measurement that the dog is at position 7.5. We want to incorporate that measurement into our belief. In the *Discrete Bayes* chapter we used histograms to denote our estimates at each hallway position, and in the *One Dimensional Kalman Filters* we used Gaussians. Both are method of using *Bayesian* probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, *Bayesian* probability is a branch of math that lets us evaluate a hypothesis or new data point given some uncertain information about the past. For example, suppose you are driving down your neighborhood street and see one of your neighbors at their door, using a key to let themselves in. Three doors down you see two people in masks breaking a window of another house. What might you conclude?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that you would reason that in the first case your neighbors were getting home and unlocking their door to get inside. In the second case you at least strongly suspect a robbery is in progress. In the first case you would just proceed on, and in the second case you'd probably call the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, things are not always what they appear. Perhaps unbeknownst to you your neighbor sold their house that morning, and they were now breaking in to steal the new owner's belongings. In the second case, perhaps the owners of the house were at a costume event at the next house, they had a medical emergency with their child, realized they lost their keys, and were breaking into their own house to get the much needed medication. Those are both *unlikely* events, but possible. Adding a few additional pieces of information would allow you to determine the true state of affairs in all but the most complicated situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are instances of *Bayesian* reasoning. We take knowledge from the past and integrate in new information. You know that your neighbor owned their house yesterday, so it is still highly likely that they still own it today. You know that owners of houses normally have keys to the front door, and that the normal mode of entrance into your own house is not breaking windows, so the second case is *likely* to be a breaking and entering. The reasoning is not ironclad as shown by the alternative explanations, but it is likely."

It is just the probability of A being true *before* we incorporate new evidence. In our dog tracking problem above, the prior is the probability we assign to our belief that the dog is positioned at 7 before we make the measurement of 7.5. It is important to master this terminology if you expect to read a lot of the literature.\n",

For example, if it is true that your neighbor still owns their house, then it will be very likely that they are not breaking into their house. In Bayesian probability this is called the *posterior*, and it denotes our new belief after incorporating the measurement/knowledge of B. For our dog tracking problem the posterior is the probability given to the estimated position after incorporating the measurement 7.5. For the neighbor problem the posterior would be the probability of a break in after you find out that your neighbor sold their home last week.\n",

    " \n",
    "A typical problem would have you compute the distance traveled given a constant velocity or acceleration. But, of course we know this is not all that is happening. First, we do not have perfect measures of things like the velocity and acceleration - there is always noise in the measurements, and we have to model that. Second, no car travels on a perfect road. There are bumps that cause the car to slow down, there is wind drag, there are hills that raise and lower the speed. If we do not have explicit knowledge of these factors we lump them all together under the term \"process noise\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to model all of those factors explicitly and exactly is impossible for anything but the most trivial problem. I could try to include equations for things like bumps in the road, the behavior of the car's suspension system, even the effects of hitting bugs with the windshield, but the job would never be done - there would always be more effects to add and limits to our knowledge (how many bugs do we hit in an hour, for example). What is worse, each of those models would in themselves be a simplification - do I assume the wind is constant, that the drag of the car is the same for all angles of the wind, that the suspension act as perfect springs, that the suspension for each wheel acts identically, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So control theory makes a mathematically correct simplification. We acknowledge that there are many factors that influence the system that we either do not know or that we don't want to have to model.

If there is a bump in the road at $t=10$ then the noise factor will just incorporate that effect. Again, this is not implying that we model, compute, or even know the value of *noise(t)*, it is merely a statement of fact - we can *always* describe the actual value as the predicted value from our idealized model plus some other value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's express this with linear algebra. Using the same notation from previous chapters, we can say that our model of the system (without noise) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{Fx}$$\n",

    "$$ f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{Fx} + \\mathbf{w}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to consider inputs into the system. We are dealing with linear problems here, so we will assume that there is some input $u$ into the system, and that we have some linear model that defines how that input changes the system. For example, if you press down on the accelerator in your car the car will accelerate. We will need a matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ to convert $u$ into the effect on the system.

The variable $\\mathbf{z}$ is just the measurement; it is typical, but not universal to use $\\mathbf{z}$ to denote measurements in the literature ($\\mathbf{y}$ is also sometimes used). Do you remember this chart?"

But $\\mathbf{K}$ is just the *Kalman gain* - the ratio of how much measurement vs prediction we should use to create the new estimate. $\\mathbf{R}$ is the *measurement noise*, and $\\mathbf{P}$ is our *uncertainty covariance matrix* from the prediction step.\n",

The linear equation $\\mathbf{ABA}^T$ can be thought of as changing the basis of $\\mathbf{B}$ to $\\mathbf{A}$. So $\\mathbf{HPH}^\\mathsf{T}$ is taking the covariance $\\mathbf{P}$ and putting it in measurement ($\\mathbf{H}$) space. \n",

The linear algebra form $\\textbf{H}\\textbf{P}\\textbf{H}^\\mathsf{T}$ takes $\\mathbf{P}$ to the basis used by $\\mathbf{H}$, namely volts. \n",

If we are confident in our measurements and unconfident in our predictions $\\mathbf{K}$ will favor the measurement, and vice versa. The equation is complicated because we are doing this in multiple dimensions via matrices, but the concept is simple - scale by a ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going into the derivation of $\\mathbf{K}$, I'll say that this equation is the result of finding a value of $\\mathbf{K}$ that optimizes the *mean-square estimation error*. It does this by finding the minimal values for $\\mathbf{P}$ along its diagonal. Recall that the diagonal of $\\mathbf{P}$ is just the variance for each state variable. So, this equation for $\\mathbf{K}$ ensures that the Kalman filter output is optimal. To put this in concrete terms, for our dog tracking problem this means that the estimates for both position and velocity will be optimal - a value of $\\mathbf{K}$ that made the position extremely accurate but the velocity very inaccurate would be rejected in favor of a $\\mathbf{K}$ that made both position and velocity just somewhat accurate."

If $K$ is small, then $(1-cK)$ is large, and P will be made larger than it was. So we adjust the size of our uncertainty by some factor of the *Kalman gain*.

    "In general the design of the $\\mathbf{Q}$ matrix is among the most difficult aspects of Kalman filter design. This is due to several factors. First, the math itself is somewhat difficult and requires a good foundation in signal theory. Second, we are trying to model the noise in something for which we have little information. For example, consider trying to model the process noise for a baseball. We can model it as a sphere moving through the air, but that leave many unknown factors - the wind, ball rotation and spin decay, the coefficient of friction of a scuffed ball with stitches, the effects of wind and air density, and so on. I will develop the equations for an exact mathematical solution for a given process model, but since the process model is incomplete the result for $\\mathbf{Q}$ will also be incomplete. This has a lot of ramifications for the behavior of the Kalman filter. If $\\mathbf{Q}$ is too small than the filter will be overconfident in it's prediction model and will diverge from the actual solution. If $\\mathbf{Q}$ is too large than the filter will be unduly influenced by the noise in the measurements and perform sub-optimally. In practice we spend a lot of time running simulations and evaluating collected data to try to select an appropriate value for $\\mathbf{Q}$. But let's start by looking at the math.\n",

We sample the system at regular intervals. Therefore we must find the discrete representation for the noise term in the equation above. However, this depends on what assumptions we make about the behavior of the noise. We will consider two different models for the noise."

    "\n",
    "> As an aside, most textbooks are more exact with the notation, in Gelb[1] for example, *Pk(+)* is used to denote the uncertainty covariance for the prediction step, and *Pk(-)* for the uncertainty covariance for the update step. Other texts use subscripts with 'k|k-1', superscript $^-$, and many other variations. As a programmer I find all of that fairly unreadable; I am used to thinking about variables changing state as a program runs, and do not use a different variable name for each new computation. There is no agreed upon format, so each author makes different choices. I find it challenging to switch quickly between books an papers, and so have adopted this admittedly less precise notation. Mathematicians will write scathing emails to me, but I hope the programmers and students will rejoice.\n",

    "> If you are a programmer trying to understand a paper's math equations, I strongly recommend just removing all of the superscripts, subscripts, and diacriticals, replacing them with a single letter. If you work with equations like this every day this is superfluous advice, but when I read I am usually trying to understand the flow of computation. To me it is far more understandable to remember that $P$ in this step represents the updated value of $P$ computed in the last step, as opposed to trying to remember what $P_{k-1}(+)$ denotes, and what its relation to $P_k(-)$ is, if any.\n",

    "This works for linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), but does not work (well) for nonlinear equations. For example, consider trying to predict the position of a rapidly turning car. Cars turn by pivoting the front wheels, which cause the car to pivot around the rear axle. Therefore the path will be continuously varying and a linear prediction will necessarily produce an incorrect value. If the change in the system is small enough relative to $\\Delta t$ this can often produce adequate results, but that will rarely be the case with the nonlinear Kalman filters we will be studying in subsequent chapters. Another problem is that even trivial systems produce differential equations for which finding closed form solutions is difficult or impossible. \n",

    "A broad category of use for the Kalman filter is *sensor fusion*. For example, we might have a position sensor and a velocity sensor, and we want to combine the data from both to find an optimal estimate of state. In this section we will discuss a different case, where we have multiple sensors providing the same type of measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    " The Global Positioning System (GPS) is designed so that at least 6 satellites are in view at any time at any point on the globe. The GPS receiver knows the location of the satellites in the sky relative to the Earth. At each epoch (instant in time) the receiver gets a signal from each satellite from which it can derive the *pseudorange* to the satellite. In more detail, the GPS receiver gets a signal identifying the satellite along with the time stamp of when the signal was transmitted. The GPS satellite has an atomic clock on board so this time stamp is extremely accurate. The signal travels at the speed of light, which is constant in a vacuum, so in theory the GPS should be able to produce an extremely accurate distance measurement to the measurement by measuring how long the signal took to reach the receiver. There are several problems with that. First, the signal is not traveling through a vacuum, but through the atmosphere. The atmosphere causes the signal to bend, so it is not traveling in a straight line. This causes the signal to take longer to reach the receiver than theory suggests. Second, the on board clock on the GPS *receiver* is not very accurate, so deriving an exact time duration is nontrivial. Third, in many environments the signal can bounce off of buildings, trees, and other objects, causing either a longer path or *multipaths*, in which case the receive receives both the original signal from space and the reflected signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this graphically. I will due this in 2D just to make it easier to graph and see, but of course this will generalize to three dimensions. We know the position of each satellite and the range to each (the range is called the *pseudorange*; we will discuss why later). We cannot measure the range exactly, so there is noise associated with the measurement, which I have depicted with the thickness of the lines. Here is an example of four pseudorange readings from four satellites. I positioned them in a configuration which is unlikely for the actual GPS constellation merely to make the intersections easy to visualize. Also, the amount of error shown is not to scale with the distances, again to make it easier to see."

    "In 2D two measurements are typically enough to determine a unique solution. There are two intersections of the range circles, but usually the second intersection is not physically realizable (it is in space, or under ground). However, with GPS we also need to solve for time, so we would need a third measurement to get a 2D position.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since GPS is a 3D system we need to solve for the 3 dimensions of space, and 1 dimension of time. That is 4 unknowns, so in theory with 4 satellites we have all the information we need. However, we normally have at least 6 satellites in view, and often more than 6. This means the system is *overdetermined*. Finally, because of the noise in the measurements none of pseudoranges intersect exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are well versed in linear algebra you know that this an extremely common problem in scientific computing, and that there are various techniques for solving overdetermined systems. Probably the most common approach used by GPS receivers to find the position is the *iterative least squares* algorithm, commonly abbreviated ILS. As you know, if the errors are Gaussian then the least squares algorithm finds the optimal solution. In other words, we want to minimize the square of the residuals for an overdetermined system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some definitions which should be familiar to you. First, we define the innovation as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta \\mathbf{z}^-= \\mathbf{z} - h(\\mathbf{x}^-)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{z}$ is the measurement, $h(\\bullet)$ is the measurement function, and $\\delta \\mathbf{z}^-$ is the innovation, which we abbreviate as $y$ in FilterPy. I don't use the $\\mathbf{x}^-$ symbology often, but it is the prediction for the state variable. In other words, this is just the equation $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{Hx}$ in the linear Kalman filter's update step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the *measurement residual* is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta \\mathbf{z}^+ = \\mathbf{z} - h(\\mathbf{x}^+)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't use the plus superscript much because I find it quickly makes the equations unreadable, but $\\mathbf{x}^+$ it is just the *a posteriori* state estimate, which is just the predicted or unknown future state. In other words, the predict step of the linear Kalman filter computes this value. Here it is stands for the value of x which the ILS algorithm will compute on each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations give us the following linear algebra equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta \\mathbf{z}^- = \\mathbf{H}\\delta \\mathbf{x} + \\delta \\mathbf{z}^+$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{H}$ is our measurement function, defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{H} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{h}}{d\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{z}}{d\\mathbf{x}}$$\n",
