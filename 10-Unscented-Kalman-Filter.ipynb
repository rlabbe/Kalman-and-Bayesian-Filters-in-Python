This is called a *Monte Carlo* approach, and it used by some Kalman filter designs, such as the Ensemble filter and particle filter. Sampling requires no specialized knowledge, and does not require a closed form solution. No matter how nonlinear or poorly behaved the function is, as long as we sample with enough sigma points we will build an accurate output distribution.\n",

    "\"Enough points\" is the rub. The graph above was created with 500,000 sigma points, and the output is still not smooth. What's worse, this is only for 1 dimension. The number of points required increases by the power of the number of dimensions. If you only needed 500 points for 1 dimension, you'd need 500 squared, or 250,000 points for two dimensions, 500 cubed, or 125,000,000 points for three dimensions, and so on. So while this approach does work, it is very computationally expensive. Ensemble filters and particle filters use clever techniques to significantly reduce this dimensionality, but the computational burdens are still very large. The unscented Kalman filter uses sigma points but drastically reduces the amount of computation by using a deterministic method to choose the points."

Matrices mean **linear** algrebra, which work for linear problems, but not nonlinear ones. So, instead of a matrix we provide a function, just like we did above. The KalmanFilter class uses another matrix $\\mathbf H$ to implement the measurement function, which converts a state into the equivalent measurement. Again, a matrix implies linearity, so instead of a matrix we provide a function.

    "At the start of the chapter I used 500,000 randomly generated sigma points to compute the the probability distribution of a Gaussian passed through a nonlinear function. While the computed mean is quite accurate, computing 500,000 points for every update would cause our filter to be extremely slow. So, what would be fewest number of sampled points that we can use, and what kinds of constraints does this problem formulation put on the points? We will assume that we have no special knowledge about the nonlinear function as we want to find a generalized algorithm that works for any function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the simplest possible case and see if it offers any insight. The simplest possible system is the **identity function**: $f(x) = x$. If our algorithm does not work for the identity function then the filter cannot converge. In other words, if the input is  1 (for a one dimensional system), the output must also be 1. If the output was different, such as 1.1, then when we fed 1.1 into the transform at the next time step, we'd get out yet another number, maybe 1.23. This filter diverges. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fewest number of points that we can use is one per dimension. This is the number that the linear Kalman filter uses. The input to a Kalman filter for the distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$ is $\\mu$ itself. So while this works for the linear case, it is not a good answer for the nonlinear case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps we can use one point per dimension, but altered somehow. However, if we were to pass some value $\\mu+\\Delta$ into the identity function $f(x)=x$ it would not converge, so this will not work. If we didn't alter $\\mu$ then this would be the standard Kalman filter. We must conclude that one sample will not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the next lowest number we can choose? Two. Consider the fact that Gaussians are symmetric, and that we probably want to always have one of our sample points be the mean of the input for the identity function to work. Two points would require us to select the mean, and then one other point. That one other point would introduce an asymmetry in our input that we probably don't want. It would be very difficult to make this work for the identity function $f(x)=x$.\n",

The strengths and weaknesses of each sensor are orthogonal to each other. This leads to the *Complementary filter*, which blends the high update rate inertial velocity measurements with the accurate but slowly updated position estimates of the GPS to produce  high rate and accurate position and velocity estimates.

Before GPS ships and aircraft navigated via various range and bearing systems such as VOR, LORAN, TACAN, DME, and so on. These systems emit beacons in the form of radio waves. The sensor extracts the range and/or bearing to the beacon from the signal. For example, an aircraft might have two VOR receivers. The pilot tunes each receiver to a different VOR station. Each VOR receiver displays the *radial* - the direction from the VOR station on the ground to the aircraft. The pilot uses a chart to find the intersection point of the radials, which identifies the location of the aircraft.\n",

    "The rest of the code runs the simulation and plots the results. I create a variable `landmarks` that contains the coordinates of the landmarks. I update the simulated robot position 10 times a second, but run the UKF only once. This is for two reasons. First, we are not using Runge Kutta to integrate the differental equations of motion, so a narrow time step allows our simulation to be more accurate. Second, it is fairly normal in embedded systems to have limited processing speed. This forces you to run your Kalman filter only as frequently as absolutely needed."

We could implement a complicated PID controlled robot simulation, but I will just generate varying steering commands using NumPy's `linspace` method. I'll also add more landmarks as the robot will be traveling much further than in the first example."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Your impression of this chapter probably depends on how many nonlinear Kalman filters you have implemented in the past. If this is your first exposure perhaps the computation of $2n+1$ sigma points and the subsequent writing of the $f(x)$ and $h(x)$ function struck you as a bit finicky. Indeed, I spent more time than I'd care to admit getting everything working because of the need to handle the modular math of angles. On the other hand, if you have implemented an extended Kalman filter (EKF) perhaps you are bouncing gleefully in your seat. There is a small amount of tedium in writing the functions for the UKF, but the concepts are very basic. The EKF for the same problem requires some fairly difficult mathematics. For many problems we cannot find a closed form solution for the equations of the EKF, and we must retreat to some sort of iterated solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the UKF over the EKF is not only the relative ease of implementation. It is somewhat premature to discuss this because you haven't learned the EKF yet, but the EKF linearizes the problem at one point and passes that point through a linear Kalman filter. In contrast, the UKF takes $2n+1$ samples. Therefore the UKF is often more accurate than the EKF, especially when the problem is highly nonlinear. While it is not true that the UKF is guaranteed to always outperform the EKF, in practice it has been shown to perform at least as well, and usually much better than the EKF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence my recommendation is to always start by implementing the UKF. If your filter has real world consequences if it diverges (people die, lots of money lost, power plant blows up) of course you will have to engage in sophisticated analysis and experimentation to choose the best filter. That is beyond the scope of this book, and you should be going to graduate school to learn this theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I have spoken of the UKF as *the* way to perform sigma point filters. This is not true. The specific version I chose is Julier's scaled unscented filter as parameterized by Van der Merwe in his 2004 dissertation. If you search for Julier, Van der Merwe, Uhlmann, and Wan you will find a family of similar sigma point filters that they developed. Each technique uses a different way of choosing and weighting the sigma points. But the choices don't stop there. For example, the SVD Kalman filter uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to find the approximate mean and covariance of the probability distribution. Think of this chapter as an introduction to the sigma point filters, rather than a definitive treatment of how they work."
