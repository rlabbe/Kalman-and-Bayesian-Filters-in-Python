    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The last chapter ended by discussing some of the drawbacks of the Discrete Bayesian filter. For many tracking and filtering problems our desire is to have a filter that is *unimodal* and *continuous*. That is, we want to model our system using floating point math (continuous) and to have only one belief represented (unimodal). For example, we want to say an aircraft is at (12.34, -95.54, 2389.5) where that is latitude, longitude, and altitude. We do not want our filter to tell us \"it might be at (1.65, -78.01, 2100.45) or it might be at (34.36, -98.23, 2543.79).\" That doesn't match our physical intuition of how the world works, and as we discussed, it can be prohibitively expensive to compute the multimodal case. And, of course, multiple position estimates makes navigating impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We desire a unimodal, continuous way to represent probabilities that models how the real world works, and that is computationally efficient to calculate. As you might guess from the chapter name, Gaussian distributions provide all of these features."

    "### Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you roll a die the *outcome* will be between 1 and 6. If we rolled a fair die a million times we'd expect to get 1 1/6 of the time. Thus we say the *probability*, or *odds* of the outcome 1 is 1/6. Likewise, if I asked you the chance of 1 being the result of the next roll you'd reply 1/6.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of values and associated probabilities is called a [*random variable*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable). *Random* does not mean the process is nondeterministic, only that we lack information. The result of a die toss is deterministic, but we lack enough information to compute the result. We don't know what will happen, except probabilistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we are defining things, the range of values is called the [*sample space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space). For a die the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. For a coin the sample space is {H, T}. *Space* is a mathematical term which means a set with structure. The sample space for the die is a subset of the natural numbers in the range of 1 to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of a random variable is the heights of students in a university. Here the sample space is a range of values in the real numbers between two limits defined by biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables such as coin tosses and die rolls are *discrete random variables*. This means their sample space is represented by either a finite number of values or a countably infinite number of values such as the natural numbers. Heights of humans are called *continuous random variables* since they can take on any real value between two limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not confuse the *measurement* of the random variable with the actual value. If we can only measure the height of a person to 0.1 meters we would only record values from 0.1, 0.2, 0.3...2.7, yielding 27 discrete choices. Nonetheless a person's height can vary between any arbitrary real value between those ranges, and so height is a continuous random variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics capital letters are used for random variables, usually from the latter half of the alphabet. So, we might say that $X$ is the random variable representing the die toss, or $Y$ are the heights of the students in the freshmen poetry class. In later chapters we will follow the convention of using  lower case for vectors, and upper case for matrices. Unfortunately these conventions clash, and you will have to determine which an author is using from context. "

    "Before we continue I need to point out that I'm ignoring that on average  men are taller than women. In general the height variance of a class that contains only men or women will be smaller than a class with both sexes. This is true for other factors as well. Well nourished children are taller than malnourished children. Scandinavians are taller than Italians. When designing experiments statisticians need to take these factors into account. \n",

For each age group there are likely to be two different means - one clustered around the mean height of the females, and a second mean clustered around the mean heights of the males. The mean of the entire class will be somewhere between the two. If we bought desks for the mean of all students we are likely to end up with desks that fit neither the males or females in the school! \n",

    "This curve is a [*probability density function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) or *pdf* for short. It shows the relative likelihood  for the random variable to take on a value. In the chart above, a student is somewhat more likely to have a height near 1.8 m than 1.7 m, and far more likely to have a height of 1.9 m vs 1.1 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I explain how to plot Gaussians, and much more, in the Notebook *Computing_and_Plotting_PDFs* in the \n",
    "Supporting_Notebooks folder. You can read it online [here](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/Supporting_Notebooks/Computing_and_plotting_PDFs.ipynb) [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be recognizable to you as a 'bell curve'. This curve is ubiquitous because under real world conditions many observations are distributed in such a manner. In fact, this is the  curve for the student heights given earlier. I will not use the term 'bell curve' to refer to a Gaussian because many probability distributions have a similar bell curve shape. Non-mathematical sources might not be as precise, so be judicious in what you conclude when you see the term used without definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This curve is not unique to heights — a vast amount of natural phenomena exhibits this sort of distribution, including the sensors that we use in filtering problems. As we will see, it also has all the attributes that we are looking for — it represents a unimodal belief or value as a probability, it is continuous, and it is computationally efficient. We will soon discover that it also has other desirable qualities which we may not realize we desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further motivate you, recall the shapes of the probability distributions in the *Discrete Bayes* chapter. They were not perfect Gaussian curves, but they were similar, as in the plot below. We will be using Gaussians to replace the discrete probabilities used in that chapter!"

This is true, but this is a common limitation of mathematical modeling. “The map is not the territory” is a common expression, and it is true for Bayesian filtering and statistics. The Gaussian distribution above models the distribution of the measured automobile speeds, but being a model it is necessarily imperfect. The difference between model and reality will come up again and again in these filters. Gaussians are used in many branches of mathematics, not because they perfectly model reality, but because they are easier to use than any other relatively accurate choice. However, even in this book Gaussians will fail to model reality, forcing us to use computationally expensive alternatives. \n",

I will use both throughout this book as different sources will use either term, and I want you to be used to seeing both. Finally, as in this paragraph, it is typical to shorten the name and talk about a *Gaussian* or *normal* — these are both typical shortcut names for the *Gaussian distribution*. "

    "What does this curve *mean*? Assume we have a thermometer which reads 22°C. No thermometer is perfectly accurate, and so we expect that each reading will be slightly off the actual value. However, a theorem called  [*Central Limit Theorem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) states that if we make many measurements that the measurements will be normally distributed.

    "Recall that a Gaussian distribution is *continuous*. Think of an infinitely long straight line - what is the probability that a point you pick randomly is at 2. Clearly 0%, as there is an infinite number of choices to choose from. The same is true for normal distributions; in the graph above the probability of being *exactly* 2°C is 0% because there are an infinite number of values the reading can take.\n",

    "What is this curve? It is something we call the *probability density function.* The area under the curve at any region gives you the probability of those values. So, for example, if you compute the area under the curve between 20 and 22 the resulting area will be the probability of the temperature reading being between those two temperatures. \n",

    "We can think of this in Bayesian terms or frequentist terms. As a Bayesian, if the thermometer reads exactly 22°C, then our belief is described by the curve - our belief that the actual (system) temperature is near 22 is very high, and our belief that the actual temperature is near 18 is very low. As a frequentist we would say that if we took 1 billion temperature measurements of a system at exactly 22°C, then a histogram of the measurements would look like this curve. \n",

    "What is this telling us? The Gaussian with $\\sigma^2=0.05$ is very narrow. It is saying that we believe $x=23$, and that we are very sure about that. In contrast, the Gaussian with $\\sigma^2=5$ also believes that $x=23$, but we are much less sure about that. Our believe that $x=23$ is lower, and so our belief about the likely possible values for $x$ is spread out — we think it is quite likely that $x=20$ or $x=26$, for example. $\\sigma^2=0.05$ has almost completely eliminated $22$ or $24$ as possible values, whereas $\\sigma^2=5$ considers them nearly as likely as $23$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think back to the thermometer, we can consider these three curves as representing the readings from three different thermometers. The curve for $\\sigma^2=0.05$ represents a very accurate thermometer, and curve for $\\sigma^2=5$ represents a fairly inaccurate one. Note the very powerful property the Gaussian distribution affords us — we can entirely represent both the reading and the error of a thermometer with only two numbers — the mean and the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An equivalent formation for a Gaussian is $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,1/\\tau)$ where $\\mu$ is the *mean* and $\\tau$ the *precision*. $1/\\tau = \\sigma^2$; it is the reciprocal of the variance. While we do not use this formulation in this book, it underscores that the variance is a measure of how precise our data is. A small variance yields large precision — our measurement is very precise. Conversely, a large variance yields low precision — our belief is spread out across a large area. You should become comfortable with thinking about Gaussians in these equivalent forms. In Bayesian terms Gaussians reflect our *belief* about a measurement, they express the *precision* of the measurement, and they express how much *variance* there is in the measurements. These are all different ways of stating the same fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm getting ahead of myself, but in the next chapters we will use Gaussians to express our belief in things like the estimated position of the object we are tracking, or the accuracy of the sensors we are using."

    "## The  68-95-99.7 Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth spending a few words on standard deviation now. The standard deviation is a measure of how much variation from the mean exists. For Gaussian distributions, 68% of all the data falls within one standard deviation ($\\pm1\\sigma$) of the mean, 95% falls within two standard deviations ($\\pm2\\sigma$), and 99.7% within three ($\\pm3\\sigma$). This is often called the [68-95-99.7 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule). If you were told that the average test score in a class was 71 with a standard deviation of 9.4, you could conclude that 95% of the students received a score between 52.2 and 89.8 if the distribution is normal (that is calculated with $71 \\pm (2 * 9.4)$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these are not arbitrary numbers. If the Gaussian for our position is $\\mu=22$ meters, then the standard deviation also has units meters. Thus $\\sigma=0.2$ implies that 68% of the measurements range from 21.8 to 22.2 meters. Variance is the standard deviation squared, thus $\\sigma^2 = .04$ meters$^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graph depicts the relationship between the standard deviation and the normal distribution. "

    "A remarkable property of Gaussians is that the product of two independent Gaussians is another Gaussian! The sum is not Gaussian, but proportional to a Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete Bayes filter works by multiplying and adding probabilities. I'm getting ahead of myself, but the Kalman filter uses Gaussians instead of probabilities, but the rest of the algorithm remains the same. This means we will need to multiply and add Gaussians. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian is a nonlinear function, and typically if you multiply a nonlinear equation with itself you end up with a different equation. For example, the shape of `sin(x)sin(x)` is very different from `sin(x)`. But the result of multiplying two Gaussians is yet another Gaussian. This is a fundamental property, and a key reason why Kalman filters are computationally feasible. Said another way, Kalman filters use Gaussians *because* they are computationally nice. \n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this section is optional. I will derive the equations for the sum and product of two Gaussians. You will not need to understand this material to understand the rest of the book, so long as you accept the results. "

    "## Fat Tails\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier I mentioned the *central limit theorem*, which states that under certain conditions the arithmetic sum of any independent random variable will be normally distributed, regardless of how the random variables are distributed. This is important to us because nature is full of distributions which are not normal, but when we apply the central limit theorem over large populations we end up with normal distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, a key part of the proof is “under certain conditions”. These conditions often do not hold for the physical world. The resulting distributions are called *fat tailed*. Tails is a colloquial term for the far left and right side parts of the curve where the probability density is close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a trivial example. We think of things like test scores as being normally distributed. If you have ever had a professor “grade on a curve” you have been subject to this assumption. But of course test scores cannot follow a normal distribution. This is because the distribution assigns a nonzero probability distribution for *any* value, no matter how far from the mean. So, for example, say your mean is 90 and the standard deviation is 13. The normal distribution assumes that there is a large chance of somebody getting a 90, and a small chance of somebody getting a 40. However, it also implies that there is a tiny chance of somebody getting a grade of -10, or 150. It assigns an infinitesimal chance of getting a score of $-10^{300}$ or $10^{32986}$. The *tails* of a Gaussian distribution are infinitely long.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for a test we know this is not true. Ignoring extra credit, you cannot get less than 0, or more than 100. Let's plot this range of values using a normal distribution."

    "The area under the curve cannot equal 1, so it is not a probability distribution. What actually happens is that more students than predicted by a normal distribution get scores nearer the upper end of the range (for example), and that tail becomes “fat”. Also, the test is probably not able to perfectly distinguish incredibly minute differences in skill in the students, so the distribution to the left of the mean is also probably a bit bunched up in places. The resulting distribution is called a [*fat tail distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-tailed_distribution). \n",

    "Kalman filters use sensors to measure the world. The errors in a sensor's measurements are rarely truly Gaussian. It is far too early to be talking about the difficulties that this presents to the Kalman filter designer. It is worth keeping in the back of your mind the fact that the Kalman filter math is based on an idealized model of the world.  For now I will present a bit of code that I will be using later in the book to form fat tail distributions to simulate various processes and sensors. This distribution is called the [*Student's $t$-distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution). \n",

    "It is unlikely that the Student's $t$-distribution is an accurate model of how your sensor (say, a GPS or Doppler) performs, and this is not a book on how to model physical systems. However, it does produce reasonable data to test your filter's performance when presented with real world noise. We will be using distributions like these throughout the rest of the book in our simulations and tests. \n",

    "This chapter is a poor introduction to statistics in general. I've only covered the concepts that  needed to use Gaussians in the remainder of the book, no more. What I've covered will not get you very far if you intend to read the Kalman filter literature. If this is a new topic to you I suggest reading a statistics textbook. I've always liked the Schaum series for self study, and Alan Downey's *Think Stats* [5] is also very good. \n",

    "The following points **must** be understood by you before we continue:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normals express a continuous probability distribution\n",
    "* They are completely described by two parameters: the mean ($\\mu$) and variance ($\\sigma^2$)\n",
    "* $\\mu$ is the average of all possible values\n",
    "* The variance $\\sigma^2$ represents how much our measurements vary from the mean\n",
    "* The standard deviation ($\\sigma$) is the square root of the variance ($\\sigma^2$)\n",
