    "If you've gotten this far I hope that you are thinking that the Kalman filter's fearsome reputation is somewhat undeserved. Sure, I hand waved some equations away, but I hope implementation has been fairly straightforward for you. The underlying concept is quite straightforward - take two measurements, or a measurement and a prediction, and choose the output to be somewhere between the two. If you believe the measurement more your guess will be closer to the measurement, and if you believe the prediction is more accurate your guess will lie closer it it.

    "We need to start by understanding the underlying equations and assumptions that the Kalman filter uses. We are trying to model real world phenomena, so what do we have to consider?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, each physical system has a process. For example, a car traveling at a certain velocity goes so far in a fixed amount of time, and its velocity varies as a function of its acceleration. We describe that behavior with the well known Newtonian equations we learned in high school.\n",
    "\n",

    "v&=at\\\\\n",
    "x &= \\frac{1}{2}at^2 + v_0t + d_0\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And once we learned calculus we saw them in this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    " \\mathbf{v} &= \\frac{d \\mathbf{x}}{d t}\\\\ \n",
    " \\quad \\mathbf{a} &= \\frac{d \\mathbf{v}}{d t} = \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{x}}{d t^2} \\,\\!\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    " $$\n",
    " \n",
    "A typical problem would have you compute the distance traveled given a constant velocity or acceleration. But, of course we know this is not all that is happening. First, we do not have perfect measures of things like the velocity and acceleration - there is always noise in the measurements, and we have to model that. Second, no car travels on a perfect road. There are bumps that cause the car to slow down, there is wind drag, there are hills that raise and lower the speed. If we do not have explicit knowledge of these factors we lump them all together under the term \"process noise\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to model all of those factors explicitly and exactly is impossible for anything but the most trivial problem. I could try to include equations for things like bumps in the road, the behavior of the car's suspension system, even the effects of hitting bugs with the windshield, but the job would never be done - there would always be more effects to add and limits to our knowledge (how many bugs do we hit in an hour, for example). What is worse, each of those models would in themselves be a simplification - do I assume the wind is constant, that the drag of the car is the same for all angles of the wind, that the suspension act as perfect springs, that the suspension for each wheel acts identically, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So control theory makes a mathematically correct simplification. We acknowledge that there are many factors that influence the system that we either do not know or that we don't want to have to model. At any time $t$ we say that the actual value (say, the position of our car) is the predicted value plus some unknown process noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x(t) = x_{pred}(t) + noise(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not meant to imply that $noise(t)$ is a function that we can derive analytically or that it is well behaved. If there is a bump in the road at $t=10$ then the noise factor will incorporate that effect. Again, this is not implying that we model, compute, or even know the value of *noise(t)*, it is merely a statement of fact - we can *always* describe the actual value as the predicted value from our idealized model plus some other value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's express this with linear algebra. Using the same notation from previous chapters, we can say that our model of the system (without noise) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{Fx}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we have a set of linear equations that describe our system. For our car, \n",
    "$\\mathbf{F}$ will be the coefficients for Newton's equations of motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to model the noise. We will call that *w*, and add it to the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{Fx} + \\mathbf{w}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to consider inputs into the system. We are dealing with linear problems here, so we will assume that there is some input $u$ into the system, and that we have some linear model that defines how that input changes the system. For example, if you press down on the accelerator in your car the car will accelerate. We will need a matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ to convert $u$ into the effect on the system. We add that into our equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{Fx} + \\mathbf{Bu} + \\mathbf{w}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it. That is one of the equations that Kalman set out to solve, and he found a way to compute an optimal solution if we assume certain properties of $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we took advantage of something I left mostly unstated in the last chapter. We were able to provide a definition for $\\mathbf{F}$ because we were able to take advantage of the exact solution that Newtonian equations provide us. However, if you have an engineering background you will realize what a small class of problems that covers. If you don't, I will explain it next, and provide you with several ways to compute $\\mathbf{F}$ for arbitrary systems."

On the other hand, the following section gives you the math, but somewhat divorced from the specifics of the problem we are trying to solve. Only you know what kind of learner you are.

    "In general the design of the $\\mathbf{Q}$ matrix is among the most difficult aspects of Kalman filter design. This is due to several factors. First, the math itself is somewhat difficult and requires a good foundation in signal theory. Second, we are trying to model the noise in something for which we have little information. For example, consider trying to model the process noise for a baseball. We can model it as a sphere moving through the air, but that leave many unknown factors - the wind, ball rotation and spin decay, the coefficient of friction of a scuffed ball with stitches, the effects of wind and air density, and so on. I will develop the equations for an exact mathematical solution for a given process model, but since the process model is incomplete the result for $\\mathbf{Q}$ will also be incomplete. This has a lot of ramifications for the behavior of the Kalman filter. If $\\mathbf{Q}$ is too small then the filter will be overconfident in its prediction model and will diverge from the actual solution. If $\\mathbf{Q}$ is too large than the filter will be unduly influenced by the noise in the measurements and perform sub-optimally. In practice we spend a lot of time running simulations and evaluating collected data to try to select an appropriate value for $\\mathbf{Q}$. But let's start by looking at the math.\n",

However, this depends on what assumptions we make about the behavior of the noise. We will consider two different models for the noise."

However, these are not fixed rules - use whichever model (or a model of your own devising) based on testing how the filter performs and/or your knowledge of the behavior of the physical model.\n",

    "If the curve is relatively straight than the line formed by the slope will not be very far from the curve. Here the step size of 1 is rather large; you can see that the slope is very close to the line at, say, 0.1. But let's continue with a step size of 1 for a moment. We can see that at $t=1$ the estimated value of $y$ is 2. Now we can compute the value at $t=2$ by taking the slope of the curve at $t=1$ and adding it to our initial estimate. The slope is computed with $y'=y$, so the slope is 2."

    "A broad category of use for the Kalman filter is *sensor fusion*. For example, we might have a position sensor and a velocity sensor, and we want to combine the data from both to find an optimal estimate of state. In this section we will discuss a different case, where we have multiple sensors providing the same type of measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    " The Global Positioning System (GPS) is designed so that at least 6 satellites are in view at any time at any point on the globe. The GPS receiver knows the location of the satellites in the sky relative to the Earth. At each epoch (instant in time) the receiver gets a signal from each satellite from which it can derive the *pseudorange* to the satellite. In more detail, the GPS receiver gets a signal identifying the satellite along with the time stamp of when the signal was transmitted. The GPS satellite has an atomic clock on board so this time stamp is extremely accurate. The signal travels at the speed of light, which is constant in a vacuum, so in theory the GPS should be able to produce an extremely accurate distance measurement to the measurement by measuring how long the signal took to reach the receiver. There are several problems with that. First, the signal is not traveling through a vacuum, but through the atmosphere. The atmosphere causes the signal to bend, so it is not traveling in a straight line. This causes the signal to take longer to reach the receiver than theory suggests. Second, the on board clock on the GPS *receiver* is not very accurate, so deriving an exact time duration is nontrivial. Third, in many environments the signal can bounce off of buildings, trees, and other objects, causing either a longer path or *multipaths*, in which case the receive receives both the original signal from space and the reflected signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this graphically. I will do this in 2D to make it easier to graph and see, but of course this will generalize to three dimensions. We know the position of each satellite and the range to each (the range is called the *pseudorange*; we will discuss why later). We cannot measure the range exactly, so there is noise associated with the measurement, which I have depicted with the thickness of the lines. Here is an example of four pseudorange readings from four satellites. I positioned them in a configuration which is unlikely for the actual GPS constellation merely to make the intersections easy to visualize. Also, the amount of error shown is not to scale with the distances, again to make it easier to see."

    "In 2D two measurements are typically enough to determine a unique solution. There are two intersections of the range circles, but usually the second intersection is not physically realizable (it is in space, or under ground). However, with GPS we also need to solve for time, so we would need a third measurement to get a 2D position.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since GPS is a 3D system we need to solve for the 3 dimensions of space, and 1 dimension of time. That is 4 unknowns, so in theory with 4 satellites we have all the information we need. However, we normally have at least 6 satellites in view, and often more than 6. This means the system is *overdetermined*. Finally, because of the noise in the measurements none of pseudoranges intersect exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are well versed in linear algebra you know that this an extremely common problem in scientific computing, and that there are various techniques for solving overdetermined systems. Probably the most common approach used by GPS receivers to find the position is the *iterative least squares* algorithm, commonly abbreviated ILS. As you know, if the errors are Gaussian then the least squares algorithm finds the optimal solution. In other words, we want to minimize the square of the residuals for an overdetermined system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some definitions which should be familiar to you. First, we define the innovation as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta \\mathbf{\\bar{z}}= \\mathbf{z} - h(\\mathbf{\\bar{x}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{z}$ is the measurement, $h(\\bullet)$ is the measurement function, and $\\delta \\mathbf{\\bar{z}}$ is the innovation, which we abbreviate as $y$ in FilterPy. In other words, this is the equation $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{H\\bar{x}}$ in the linear Kalman filter's update step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the *measurement residual* is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta \\mathbf{z}^+ = \\mathbf{z} - h(\\mathbf{x}^+)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't use the plus superscript much because I find it quickly makes the equations unreadable, but $\\mathbf{x}^+$ is the *a posteriori* state estimate, which is the predicted or unknown future state. In other words, the predict step of the linear Kalman filter computes this value. Here it is stands for the value of x which the ILS algorithm will compute on each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations give us the following linear algebra equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta \\mathbf{z}^- = \\mathbf{H}\\delta \\mathbf{x} + \\delta \\mathbf{z}^+$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{H}$ is our measurement function, defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{H} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{h}}{d\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{z}}{d\\mathbf{x}}$$\n",
